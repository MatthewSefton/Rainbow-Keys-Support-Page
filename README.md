About

Rainbow keys uses object recognition and your iphone camera to display the names of the keys onto your keyboard or piano.

Use

To use Rainbow Keys, hold your camera over your piano or keyboard. You can select from scales or chords at the top of the screen and use the inputs to display the chord or scale of your choice. To play D natural minor, for instance, make sure that 'Scales' is selected, then, on the key input, select the key of D. On the scales input, select 'Minor (natural)'. To play the scale, start on the key of D and work your way up the piano. This app can be used in either portrait or landscape mode. The free version of this app has all the basic chords and scales. For more advanced chords and scales, you can upgrade to the premium version for $9.99. Simply press the upgrade button in the top left corner of the app.

Troubleshooting

If the notes on the piano are not being displayed at all, trying facing the camera forwards before moving it back down again to face the piano.
If the notes are not being displayed correctly, make sure you are holding the camera at a reasonably high distance above the keyboard (at least 20cm). 
If you cover the keyboard with your hand, the app will not function correctly as it needs to be able to see the keys in order to detect which notes are in view.
